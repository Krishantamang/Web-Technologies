Alt Tag
It stands for Alternative Tag.It is used to alert the user about the information in the website in more detail. For example if a blind person stumbels upon the image which has a alt tag then the website tells the user that there is a image there. It is also used to make the website userfriendly. If your network is very weak and if the image doesnt load then if a alt tag is used then it shows a logo and the image name.

Title Tag
It is also used to alert user about the information in the website in more detail. If we use a title tag then, when we hover our curser over the image it shows the title that we have inserted while coding.
